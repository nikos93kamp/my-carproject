The project we will be building will be called CarProject.
The project will be split into two parts one for the managers and one for the customers
We will build a seperate admin area for the managers where they can submit the cars, change their profile and similar
and then there will be a part where the customers can find available cars, entry a car,
and also contact the managers.

How to start the project:
1) Clone the project from github
2) Create a virtual environment
3) Activate the virtual environment
4) Run the command pip freeze > requirements.txt
5) Go to the carproject
6) Run the command python manage.py runserver
