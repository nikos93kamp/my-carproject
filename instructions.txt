The project we will be building will be called CarProject.
The project will be split into two parts one for the managers and one for the customers
We will build a seperate admin area for the managers where they can submit the cars, change their profile and similar
and then there will be a part where the customers can find available cars, entry a car,
and also contact the managers.

How to start the project:
1) Download from github
2) cd path to your folder
3) venv\Scripts\activate
4) cd carproject
5) python manage.py runserver
